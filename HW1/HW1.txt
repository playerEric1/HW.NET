2. Value Type
   Stored on the stack.
   Directly contains data.
   Examples: int, float, bool, struct.

   Reference Type
   Stored on the heap.
   Contains a reference (address) to the actual data.
   Examples: class, interface, string, array.

   Boxing is the process of converting a value type to a reference type.
   Example: object obj = 123; // Boxing the integer 123 into an object.
   Unboxing is the process of converting a reference type back to a value type.
   Example: int num = (int)obj; // Unboxing the object back to an integer.
3. Managed Resources are resources that are handled by the .NET runtime's garbage collector such as objects, arrays, strings.
   Unmanaged Resource are resources that are not handled by the garbage collector such as file handles, database connections, unmanaged memory.
4. It ensures efficient memory use, helps prevent memory leaks, and reduces the need for manual memory management.

1. System.DivideByZeroException
2. Infinity/-Infinity/NaN if 0/0
3. it wraps around to the minimum value if you exceed the maximum or the maximum value if you go below the minimum
4.  x = y++ y is incremented after its value is assigned to x
    x = ++y y is incremented before its value is assigned to x
5.  break: Exits the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement immediately.
    continue: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
    return: Exits the current method and optionally returns a value to the caller.
6.  Initialization: Executed once before the loop starts.
    Condition: Evaluated before each iteration; if false, the loop exits.
    Iterator: Executed after each iteration.
    Only condition is required.
7. = is Assignment and == is equality comparison
8. Yes
9. It is a discard pattern, which matches any value not matched by previous cases.
10. IEnumerable
